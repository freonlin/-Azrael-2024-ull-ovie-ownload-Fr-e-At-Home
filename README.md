Azrael: A Deep Dive into the Dark Heart of Indian Patriarchy
Kanu Behl's "Azrael" is not a film for the faint of heart. It is a visceral, unflinching exploration of the suffocating grip of patriarchy in India, told through the lens of male sexual frustration and the warped power dynamics within a family. Premiering at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival Directors' Fortnight to a five-minute standing ovation, the film has sparked both acclaim and controversy for its raw portrayal of a deeply disturbing reality. This article delves into the various facets of "Azrael," examining its plot, characters, themes, critical reception, and the broader social context it reflects.

Where to Watch Azrael:

As of November 2023, "Azrael" has primarily been screened at film festivals, including Cannes, the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne, the Busan International Film Festival, the Hong Kong Asian Film Festival, and the MAMI film festival. While a wider theatrical or streaming release is anticipated, specific details are yet to be announced. Keep an eye out for updates from the film's distributors, Les Films de l'Atalante, and production companies, Saregama India Ltd, UFO Production, and O28 Films.

What is the Movie Azrael About?

"Azrael" follows the story of Guru (Mohit Agarwal), a young man trapped in a claustrophobic existence within his family home in Azrael, India. Working a dead-end call center job, Guru yearns for intimacy and escape but finds himself stifled by the oppressive patriarchal structures that govern his life. His father, "Daddy ji" (Rahul Roy), is a domineering figure who exerts control over the household, while his mother, "Mummy ji" (Vibha Chibber), remains complicit in this power dynamic. Guru's desires are further complicated by his infatuation with his aunt, "Aunty ji" (Sonal Jha), and his strained relationship with his cousin, Chhavi (Aanchal Goswami).

As Guru's frustration mounts, he descends into a psychological spiral, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. He seeks solace in online dating apps and engages in acts of self-harm, his desperation escalating as he struggles to find agency and fulfillment within the confines of his suffocating environment.

What is the Story of Azrael?

The narrative of "Azrael" unfolds as a psychological drama, delving into the inner turmoil of Guru as he navigates the complexities of his familial relationships and his own repressed desires. The film paints a bleak picture of a society where traditional gender roles and power imbalances perpetuate cycles of frustration and abuse. Guru's journey becomes a microcosm of the larger societal issues at play, highlighting the damaging effects of patriarchy on both men and women.

The film's setting, Azrael, the city of the Taj Mahal, adds another layer of meaning to the narrative. The iconic monument, a symbol of love and beauty, stands in stark contrast to the ugliness and dysfunction that permeate Guru's life. This juxtaposition underscores the film's exploration of the dissonance between idealized notions of romance and the harsh realities of a society grappling with deep-seated social issues.

Is Azrael a Real Story?

While "Azrael" is not based on a specific true story, it draws inspiration from the lived experiences of many individuals in India. The film's themes of patriarchal oppression, sexual frustration, and the psychological toll of societal pressures resonate with a broader reality.

Guru's interactions with his father, aunt, cousin, and the women he encounters online paint a complex picture of the power dynamics at play.

The film's narrative is non-linear, employing dream sequences, flashbacks, and fragmented storytelling to depict Guru's fractured mental state. This stylistic choice mirrors the protagonist's internal chaos and the blurring of boundaries between his desires and reality.

The Taj Mahal: The iconic monument serves as a stark contrast to the grim reality of Guru's life, highlighting the disconnect between idealized notions of love and the harsh realities of societal dysfunction.

The Train: The train, a recurring motif in the film, represents Guru's desire for escape and his yearning for a different life beyond the confines of his family home.

The Phone: Guru's constant use of his phone and engagement with dating apps symbolize his attempts to find connection and intimacy in a virtual world, reflecting the increasing role of technology in modern relationships.

Guru's Room: Guru's cramped and cluttered room represents his suffocating existence and the lack of personal space he experiences within his family home.
